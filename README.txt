Description:

CMSimple_XH is a fast, small, easy-to-use and
easy-to-install modular Content Management
System (CMS), which doesn't need a database.

It is free Open Source Software under the
GPL3 Licence.

CMSimple_XH stores the content of the different
pages in one single html-file (content.htm).

In default setting headings H1-H3 are used
to split the content.htm into single pages
and to generate the navigation menu, while
headings H4-H6 remain for normal semantic
structuring within pages.
